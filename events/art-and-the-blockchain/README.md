# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://amsterdamblockchainweek.org/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

synopsis:
  - The general conception of NFTs is surrounded by myth and misunderstanding. NFTs are nothing more than linked images, and worse, they are artistically uninteresting. This show handpicks a selection of NFTs from the plethora that is out there to unveil some myths, and to show the width and depth of this cultural phenonemon. More specifically, the show zooms in on the expanding field of fine art within the context of the blockchain. In a tradition that started in the 60's of the previous century, this is just the last step in the evolution of Digital Art.
  - Showcasing artists working digitally as from the mid nineties. Blockchain art is a next step in networked art, if you like it or not. Showcasing NFTs as generative works, instructional pieces, self destroying works, AR virtual installations, mutating compositions, hybrid web and web3 works. Conceptual, textual, abstract and figurative works. Absurd, mythological, contemplative, wonderous and hilarious works.
